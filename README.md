NaturalDB is an open-source project that revolutionizes database interaction by
allowing users to query and manage their databases using natural language. With
a focus on privacy and ease of use, this tool is perfect for developers, data
analysts, and database administrators looking for a more intuitive way to work
with their data.

Originally created for the midudev and Vercel hackathon, NaturalDB has grown
into a powerful solution for simplifying database interactions through natural
language processing.

## Features

- 🗣️ Natural language queries for database interactions
- 🔒 Privacy-focused: all data and API keys are stored locally
- 📊 Real-time database schema visualization
- 💬 Interactive chat interface for query refinement
- 🔄 Support for multiple database connections

## Demo

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/drumst0ck/naturalDB.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   cd naturalDB
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works

1. User inputs a natural language query
2. The AI processes the query and generates SQL
3. SQL is executed on the connected database
4. Results are displayed in a user-friendly format

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community!
